# ðŸš¦ Quality Gates Configuration

This document defines the quality gates and standards for the PipelineKit project.

## Overview

Quality gates ensure that all code meets our standards for security, performance, reliability, and maintainability before being merged or released.

## Gate Levels

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Blocking)
These gates MUST pass for any PR to be merged:

- **Build**: Code must compile on all supported platforms
- **Tests**: All unit tests must pass (100% pass rate)
- **Security**: No critical or high vulnerabilities detected
- **Lint**: Code must pass SwiftLint with strict configuration

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Warning)
These gates SHOULD pass but can be overridden with justification:

- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Performance**: No performance regressions >10%
- **Documentation**: Public APIs must be documented
- **Size**: PR should be <500 lines of changes

### ðŸŸ¢ Recommended (Informational)
These gates provide information but don't block:

- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function
- **Duplication**: <3% code duplication
- **Dependencies**: No outdated dependencies
- **Benchmarks**: Performance metrics tracked

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **Swift Version**: 6.0 with strict concurrency
- **Style Guide**: Swift API Design Guidelines
- **Formatting**: swift-format with project configuration
- **Naming**: Clear, descriptive names following conventions

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: Required for all public APIs
- **Integration Tests**: Required for critical paths
- **Performance Tests**: Required for performance-critical code
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum, 90% goal

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: All sensitive operations require authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest
- **Validation**: Input validation on all external data
- **Audit**: Security-relevant events logged

### Performance Standards
- **Throughput**: >50,000 operations/second baseline
- **Latency**: <1ms p99 for simple operations
- **Memory**: No memory leaks detected
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe with actor isolation

## Enforcement

### Pull Requests
1. **Automated Checks**: GitHub Actions run all gates
2. **Required Reviews**: 1+ approvals from maintainers
3. **Status Checks**: All critical gates must pass
4. **Comments**: Bot comments with quality report

### Releases
1. **Full Test Suite**: All tests on all platforms
2. **Security Scan**: Comprehensive vulnerability scan
3. **Performance Tests**: Full benchmark suite
4. **Documentation**: Generated and validated
5. **Artifacts**: Built for all supported platforms

## Gate Configuration

### SwiftLint Rules
```yaml
included:
  - Sources
  - Tests
excluded:
  - .build
  - docs
rules:
  line_length:
    warning: 120
    error: 150
  file_length:
    warning: 400
    error: 600
  function_body_length:
    warning: 40
    error: 60
  cyclomatic_complexity:
    warning: 10
    error: 15
```

### Test Coverage
```yaml
coverage:
  minimum: 80
  target: 90
  exclude:
    - Tests/*
    - Sources/*/Mocks/*
    - Sources/*/Examples/*
```

### Security Scanning
```yaml
security:
  tools:
    - trivy
    - trufflehog
  severity:
    block: [CRITICAL, HIGH]
    warn: [MEDIUM]
    info: [LOW, UNKNOWN]
```

## Exemptions

Exemptions to quality gates may be granted in exceptional circumstances:

1. **Emergency Fixes**: Critical production issues
2. **External Dependencies**: Third-party library constraints
3. **Legacy Code**: Gradual improvement of existing code
4. **Experimental Features**: Marked as experimental/beta

To request an exemption:
1. Document the reason in the PR description
2. Add `qa-exemption` label
3. Get approval from 2+ maintainers
4. Create follow-up issue for resolution
