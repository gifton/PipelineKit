# SafetyMonitor Resource Tracking - Future Improvements

This document tracks medium and low priority improvements identified during the resource tracking implementation analysis. The critical and high priority issues (TOCTOU race and unbounded registry) are being addressed in the main implementation plan.

## Medium Priority Improvements

### Task Creation Overhead
- **Issue**: Every ResourceHandle deinit creates a new detached Task
- **Impact**: High-frequency allocation/deallocation creates task storm
- **Solutions**:
  - [ ] Implement batched deallocation with async queue
  - [ ] Use single cleanup task with channel/queue pattern
  - [ ] Consider synchronous cleanup for low-contention scenarios
  - [ ] Add configurable cleanup strategies (immediate vs batched)

### Observability & Metrics
- **Issue**: No visibility into resource allocation patterns
- **Impact**: Difficult to debug issues or optimize performance
- **Solutions**:
  - [ ] Add allocation rate metrics per resource type
  - [ ] Implement failure counters with reason codes
  - [ ] Create resource lifetime histograms
  - [ ] Integration with MetricCollector
  - [ ] Add dashboard-ready metric exports
  - [ ] Implement allocation pattern analysis

### Non-Atomic Registry Operations
- **Issue**: Counter and registry updates not synchronized
- **Impact**: Potential inconsistency between counter and registry size
- **Solutions**:
  - [ ] Implement transactional updates for counter+registry
  - [ ] Add consistency checks in debug mode
  - [ ] Create audit method to detect/repair inconsistencies

## Low Priority Enhancements

### Enhanced Debugging Support
- [ ] Capture allocation stack traces (debug mode only)
- [ ] Track resource ownership chains
- [ ] Add resource genealogy tracking
- [ ] Implement debug dump functionality
- [ ] Create resource leak analysis tools
- [ ] Add allocation hotspot detection

### Leak Detection Improvements
- [ ] Configurable leak detection thresholds
- [ ] Different thresholds per resource type
- [ ] Leak severity classification
- [ ] Integration with alerting systems
- [ ] Historical leak pattern analysis
- [ ] Predictive leak detection

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Resource pools with recycling
- [ ] Pre-allocated resource slots
- [ ] NUMA-aware allocation strategies
- [ ] CPU cache-line optimization
- [ ] Lock-free registry alternatives

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Priority-based resource allocation
- [ ] Resource reservation system
- [ ] Guaranteed resource quotas
- [ ] Fair scheduling algorithms
- [ ] Resource sharing between monitors
- [ ] Hierarchical resource limits

### Operational Features
- [ ] Resource usage forecasting
- [ ] Capacity planning tools
- [ ] Auto-scaling triggers
- [ ] Resource pressure notifications
- [ ] Historical trend analysis
- [ ] Anomaly detection

## Implementation Notes

These improvements should be considered after the critical fixes are stable and proven. Each improvement should:

1. Have clean API design
2. Be feature-flagged for gradual rollout
3. Include comprehensive testing
4. Have minimal performance impact
5. Be well-documented with examples

## Dependencies

Some improvements depend on other systems:
- Metrics integration requires MetricCollector updates
- Debugging features may need compiler flags
- Advanced features might need API additions
