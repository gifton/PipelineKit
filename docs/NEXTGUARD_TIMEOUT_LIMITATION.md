# NextGuard: Deinit‑Time Warning Limitation

## Overview

NextGuard enforces exactly‑once and non‑concurrent `next()` calls at runtime using atomics. In debug builds, it also emits a deinit‑time warning if `next()` was never called. Swift’s cancellation and actor isolation can make deinit timing nondeterministic in exceptional flows (e.g., timeouts). This affects only the warning signal, not runtime correctness.

## The Problem

### What NextGuard Does
`NextGuard` is a safety wrapper that ensures middleware calls its `next()` closure exactly once. It detects three types of violations:
1. Multiple calls to `next()` 
2. Concurrent calls to `next()`
3. Forgetting to call `next()` (detected in debug builds via `deinit`)

### The Limitation
When a timeout occurs in the pipeline:
1. `TimeoutMiddleware` calls `group.cancelAll()` to cancel the task group
2. The middleware chain is immediately deallocated
3. `NextGuard.deinit` runs **synchronously** to check if `next()` was called
4. At this point, `Task.isCancelled` may not yet be `true` because cancellation is cooperative and asynchronous
5. A deinit‑time warning may be emitted even when the pipeline behaved correctly

### Why This Can't Be Easily Fixed

#### Swift's Actor Model Constraint
```swift
// CommandContext is an actor (async access only)
actor CommandContext {
    func getCancellationReason() -> CancellationReason? { ... }
}

// But NextGuard.deinit is synchronous
class NextGuard {
    deinit {
        // ❌ Can't await here - deinit is synchronous
        // if await context.getCancellationReason() != nil { ... }
        
        // ❌ Task.isCancelled might not be set yet
        if Task.isCancelled { ... }
    }
}
```

#### The Deinit Timing Race
```
Timeline of a timeout:
T0: Timeout duration expires
T1: group.cancelAll() called
T2: Middleware tasks begin cleanup
T3: NextGuard.deinit runs (synchronous)
T4: Task cancellation propagates (asynchronous)
T5: Task.isCancelled becomes true (too late!)
```

## Recommended Approach

Instead of heuristics, PipelineKit uses explicit controls:

1) Keep warnings enabled in development; they catch real bugs (missed/duplicate `next()` calls).

2) For middleware that intentionally short‑circuits (e.g., cache hits), conform to `NextGuardWarningSuppressing` to suppress debug‑only deinit warnings for that middleware.

3) In CI or specialized tests, temporarily disable warnings using `NextGuard.withoutWarnings { ... }` utilities or register a no‑op warning handler via `NextGuardConfiguration.setWarningHandler(_:)`.

## Impact Assessment

### For Package Users

#### Severity: **LOW to MEDIUM**

The limitation affects **developer experience**, not runtime behavior:

| Aspect | Impact | Severity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Runtime Behavior** | None - code executes correctly | ✅ None |
| **Data Integrity** | No corruption or loss | ✅ None |
| **Performance** | No overhead | ✅ None |
| **Security** | No vulnerabilities | ✅ None |
| **Developer Experience** | False warnings in logs | ⚠️ Medium |
| **Debugging** | Harder to identify real bugs | ⚠️ Medium |
| **Testing** | Potential flaky tests | ⚠️ Low |

### Real-World Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Normal Development
```swift
// Developer implements custom timeout middleware
class CustomDeadlineMiddleware: Middleware {
    func execute(...) {
        // When this times out, logs show:
        // ⚠️ WARNING: NextGuard(CustomDeadlineMiddleware) deallocated without calling next()
        // Developer wastes time investigating a non-issue
    }
}
```

#### Scenario 2: Production Monitoring
```swift
// If warnings are logged in production:
// - Log aggregation systems get polluted
// - May trigger false alerts
// - Team develops "warning fatigue"
// - Real bugs might be ignored
```

#### Scenario 3: CI/CD Pipeline
```swift
// Tests might fail intermittently:
// - Pass on fast machines (Task.isCancelled sets quickly)
// - Fail on slow CI runners (race condition loses)
// - Inconsistent results frustrate team
```

### Who Is Affected?

1. **Library Users (Low Impact)**
   - See occasional false warnings
   - Can disable warnings in production
   - Timeouts still work correctly

2. **Library Developers (Medium Impact)**
   - Must maintain brittle string heuristics
   - Can't write robust tests for timeout scenarios
   - Technical debt accumulates

3. **Large Teams (Medium Impact)**
   - Must coordinate naming conventions
   - New developers need education about the limitation
   - Code reviews must catch naming issues

## Is This Worth Fixing?

### Arguments AGAINST Heuristics

1. **It's a Swift limitation, not a PipelineKit bug**
   - This is a fundamental constraint of Swift's concurrency model
   - Many Swift libraries face similar issues
   - Swift Evolution may address this in future versions

2. **The impact is cosmetic**
   - No runtime errors
   - No data corruption
   - Just log noise

3. **Workarounds add complexity**
   - Global state breaks actor isolation benefits
   - `@unchecked Sendable` reduces safety
   - Complex solutions for a minor problem

4. **Time investment vs. benefit**
   - Significant engineering effort required
   - Benefits are marginal (cleaner logs)
   - Could introduce new bugs

### Arguments FOR the Current Approach

1. **Professional polish**
   - False warnings look unprofessional
   - Reduces confidence in the library
   - First impressions matter for adoption

2. **Developer experience**
   - Warning fatigue is real
   - Time wasted on false positives adds up
   - Frustration accumulates over time

3. **Future maintenance**
   - String heuristics are fragile
   - Will break with refactoring
   - Technical debt compounds

## Recommendation

### Current Status: **Known Limitation (Debug‑Only Warning)**

**This limitation is NOT worth extensive engineering effort to fix because:**

1. **Impact is low**: Only affects debug logging, not functionality
2. **Swift will likely improve**: Future Swift versions may provide better cancellation APIs
3. **Workarounds are fragile**: Alternative approaches introduce their own problems
4. **Cost/benefit ratio is poor**: High effort for marginal improvement

### Suggested Approach

1. **Document prominently** ✅ (this document)
2. **Disable in production**: Only emit warnings in DEBUG builds
3. **Improve heuristics gradually**: Add more timeout-related string patterns as needed
4. **Wait for Swift Evolution**: Monitor proposals for better cancellation handling
5. **Re-evaluate periodically**: Revisit when Swift adds new concurrency features

### Configuration Options

```swift
// Enable/disable warnings globally
NextGuardConfiguration.shared.emitWarnings = true

// Route warnings to your logger
NextGuardConfiguration.setWarningHandler { message in
    logger.warning("[NextGuard] \(message)")
}
```

## Conclusion

This is a **legitimate limitation** imposed by Swift's concurrency model, not a design flaw in PipelineKit. The impact is primarily on developer experience rather than functionality. While frustrating, it's not severe enough to warrant complex workarounds that could introduce worse problems.

**The pragmatic choice is to accept this limitation** for deinit‑time warnings, use explicit suppression for legitimate short‑circuits, and keep runtime safety guarantees intact.
