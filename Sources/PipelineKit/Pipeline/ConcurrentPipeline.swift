/// A thread-safe pipeline manager that supports concurrent command execution with controlled concurrency.
///
/// `ConcurrentPipeline` manages multiple pipelines for different command types and provides
/// controlled concurrent execution using an async semaphore. It ensures that only a limited
/// number of commands execute simultaneously, preventing resource exhaustion.
///
/// ## Overview
/// This actor provides:
/// - Registration of pipelines for specific command types
/// - Concurrent execution of multiple commands with concurrency limits
/// - Type-safe command routing to appropriate pipelines
/// - Batch execution with individual error handling
///
/// ## Example
/// ```swift
/// // Create a concurrent pipeline with max 5 concurrent operations
/// let concurrentPipeline = ConcurrentPipeline(maxConcurrency: 5)
///
/// // Register pipelines for different command types
/// await concurrentPipeline.register(CreateUserCommand.self, pipeline: userPipeline)
/// await concurrentPipeline.register(SendEmailCommand.self, pipeline: emailPipeline)
///
/// // Execute a single command
/// let user = try await concurrentPipeline.execute(
///     CreateUserCommand(name: "John"),
///     metadata: metadata
/// )
///
/// // Execute multiple commands concurrently
/// let commands = [
///     SendEmailCommand(to: "user1@example.com"),
///     SendEmailCommand(to: "user2@example.com"),
///     SendEmailCommand(to: "user3@example.com")
/// ]
/// let results = try await concurrentPipeline.executeConcurrently(commands)
/// ```
