// MARK: - Fluent Pipeline Builder with Operators

/// A fluent interface builder for constructing pipelines using operator syntax.
///
/// This builder implements the **Fluent Interface** design pattern, allowing you to
/// chain middleware additions in a readable, expressive way that flows like natural language.
/// It supports custom operators for an even more intuitive developer experience.
///
/// ## What Makes It "Fluent"?
///
/// Traditional approach requires multiple separate calls:
/// ```swift
/// let builder = PipelineBuilder(handler: userHandler)
/// await builder.with(authMiddleware)
/// await builder.with(validationMiddleware)
/// let pipeline = try await builder.build()
/// ```
///
/// Fluent approach chains operations naturally:
/// ```swift
/// let pipeline = try await pipeline(for: userHandler)
///     <+ authMiddleware
///     <++ middleware(validationMiddleware, priority: .validation)
///     <+ loggingMiddleware
///     .build()
/// ```
///
/// ## Available Operators
///
/// - `<+` - Adds middleware without priority
/// - `<++` - Adds middleware with execution priority
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// ### Basic middleware chain:
/// ```swift
/// let pipeline = try await pipeline(for: CreateUserHandler())
///     <+ AuthenticationMiddleware()
///     <+ ValidationMiddleware()
///     <+ LoggingMiddleware()
///     .build()
/// ```
///
/// ### With execution priorities:
/// ```swift
/// let pipeline = try await pipeline(for: handler)
///     <++ middleware(AuthMiddleware(), priority: .authentication)
///     <++ middleware(ValidationMiddleware(), priority: .validation)
///     <+ LoggingMiddleware()  // No priority needed
///     .build()
/// ```
///
/// ### Mixed with conditional logic:
/// ```swift
/// let pipeline = try await pipeline(for: handler)
///     <+ AuthenticationMiddleware()
///     <+ (isProduction ? ProductionLoggingMiddleware() : DebugMiddleware())
///     <+ ValidationMiddleware()
///     .build()
/// ```
///
/// ## Benefits
///
/// - **Readability**: Code reads naturally from top to bottom
/// - **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of the entire chain  
/// - **Discoverability**: IDE auto-completion guides you through options
/// - **Maintainability**: Easy to add, remove, or reorder middleware
/// - **Expressiveness**: Operators make intent clear and concise
///
/// ## Performance Notes
///
/// The fluent builder collects components during chaining and processes them
/// efficiently in a single pass during `build()`. There's no performance penalty
/// compared to traditional builder patterns.
