// MARK: - Core Protocol

/// A logger for audit events in the pipeline system.
///
/// This protocol defines a minimal interface for audit logging with a single
/// method, making it easy to mock, test, and extend. Implementations can
/// choose their own concurrency model (actor, struct, class) as needed.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// let logger = ConsoleAuditLogger()
/// await logger.log(CommandLifecycleEvent(
///     phase: .started,
///     commandType: "CreateUser",
///     commandId: UUID()
/// ))
/// ```
public protocol AuditLogger: Sendable {
    /// Logs an audit event asynchronously.
    ///
    /// This method should never throw - audit logging failures should not
    /// interrupt business logic. Implementations should handle errors
    /// internally and optionally report them via the health stream.
    ///
    /// - Parameter event: The audit event to log
    func log(_ event: any AuditEvent) async
    
    /// A stream of health events for monitoring logger status.
    ///
    /// Implementations can use this to report issues like dropped events,
    /// backpressure, or sink failures. The default implementation returns
    /// a finished stream, indicating no health monitoring.
