/// Optimized middleware chain that pre-sorts and compiles middleware for better performance.
///
/// This lightweight optimizer provides:
/// - Pre-sorted middleware by priority (avoiding repeated sorting)
/// - Early detection of short-circuit capable middleware
/// - Simplified execution path without complex abstractions
///
/// ## Design Philosophy
/// 
/// This optimizer follows the principle of "do the minimum necessary for real benefit".
/// It avoids complex parallel execution, dependency graphs, and capability protocols
/// in favor of simple, predictable optimizations that provide 90% of the benefit
/// with 10% of the complexity.
///
/// ## Performance Impact
///
/// - Pre-sorting eliminates O(n log n) sort on each execution
/// - Short-circuit detection enables fast-path for auth/validation failures
/// - Direct function composition reduces overhead vs array iteration
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// The optimizer itself is immutable after construction and safe to share
/// across concurrent executions.
