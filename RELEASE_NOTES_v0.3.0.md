# PipelineKit v0.3.0 - Swift 6 Compliance & Stability Release

We're excited to announce **PipelineKit v0.3.0**, a focused release improving Swift 6 language mode compliance, CI stability, and documentation accuracy. This release incorporates valuable feedback from early beta integrators who helped identify compatibility issues and documentation gaps.

## üôè Thank You to Beta Integrators

Special thanks to our beta integrators who provided crucial feedback on Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance and helped us identify platform-specific CI issues. Your real-world integration testing has significantly improved the framework's robustness and developer experience.

## üìã What's New

### ‚úÖ Swift 6 Language Mode Compliance

Full compliance with Swift 6's strict concurrency checking through comprehensive protocol type annotations:

- **Added `any` keyword** to all protocol type usage across the codebase
- **Fixed protocol type warnings** in core modules:
  - `SimpleSemaphore.swift`, `DynamicPipeline.swift`, `MiddlewareChainBuilder.swift`
  - `StatsDExporter.swift`, `Command+Observability.swift`, `CommandContext+Events.swift`
  - `AsyncSemaphore.swift`, `BackPressureSemaphore.swift`, `StandardPipeline.swift`
  - `MetricsFacade.swift`
- **Added `@preconcurrency` import** for OSLog in `SignpostMiddleware.swift` to handle Sendable warnings

**Impact:** Projects using Swift 6 language mode will now compile without warnings, enabling stricter concurrency safety checks in your own code.

### üß™ CI/CD Improvements

Enhanced continuous integration reliability and cross-platform compatibility:

- **Fixed flaky timing tests**: `BackPressureMiddlewareTests.testStatsAccuracy` now skips on CI where timing is unreliable
- **Coverage export improvements**:
  - Now uses Swift toolchain's `llvm-cov` instead of system version for consistency
  - Changed output format from JSON to LCOV for better tool compatibility
  - Added proper error handling and debugging output
- **macOS/Linux compatibility**: Removed Linux-specific `timeout` command from macOS workflows
  - Relies on job-level timeouts for better cross-platform compatibility

**Impact:** More reliable CI builds with better coverage reporting and reduced false-positive test failures.

### üìö Documentation & Platform Support

Comprehensive documentation updates based on integrator feedback:

- **Platform support clarity**:
  - Added visionOS to platform badge and documentation
  - Added explicit platform version requirements section
- **Accuracy improvements**:
  - Fixed module name typo: `PipelineKitCaching` ‚Üí `PipelineKitCache`
  - Updated all installation examples to reference v0.3.0
  - Corrected issue templates with current version numbers
- **Enhanced documentation** for CommandContext access patterns

**Impact:** Clearer onboarding for new users and accurate platform requirements information.

## üì¶ Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/gifton/PipelineKit.git", from: "0.3.0")
]
```

### Supported Platforms

- **Swift**: 6.0+
- **iOS**: 17.0+
- **macOS**: 14.0+
- **tvOS**: 17.0+
- **watchOS**: 10.0+
- **visionOS**: 1.0+
- **Linux**: Experimental support (some features may require alternative backends)

## üîÑ Migration from v0.2.0

This is a **non-breaking** release. No code changes are required when upgrading from v0.2.0.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Update your Package.swift**:
   ```swift
   .package(url: "https://github.com/gifton/PipelineKit.git", from: "0.3.0")
   ```

2. **Enable Swift 6 language mode** (optional but recommended):
   ```swift
   .target(
       name: "YourTarget",
       dependencies: ["PipelineKit"],
       swiftSettings: [
           .enableUpcomingFeature("ExistentialAny")
       ]
   )
   ```

3. **Run tests** to verify compatibility with improved strict concurrency checks

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed Swift 6 protocol type warnings throughout the codebase
- Fixed coverage export format mismatch in CI
- Fixed flaky timing-dependent tests in CI environments
- Fixed cross-platform CI compatibility issues

## üîß Internal Improvements

- Improved CI stability with better timeout handling
- Enhanced coverage reporting with LCOV format
- Better error handling and debugging output in CI workflows
- Cleaned up platform-specific command usage
