# Disable rules that are less critical in test code
disabled_rules:
  - force_unwrapping        # OK to use ! in tests for brevity
  - pattern_matching_keywords  # if case is fine in tests
  - empty_count            # .count == 0 is readable in tests
  - for_where              # Simple for-in with if is fine in tests
  - multiline_arguments    # Test readability over strict formatting
  - vertical_parameter_alignment_on_call  # Less critical in tests
  - file_length            # Test files can be longer
  - type_body_length       # Test classes can be longer
  - function_body_length   # Test functions can be longer
  - unchecked_sendable_documentation  # Test helpers often need mutable state for tracking
